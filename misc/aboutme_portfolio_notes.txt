Scholastically: I went to business school to study Accounting, and finished up my undergraduate studies in December 2017. I was drawn to the Accounting field because I've always been a bit of a math nut, but Accounting specifically seemed like a field that was indispensable--everyone needs a tax guy.

The two most important things I took away from school aren't related to Accounting, ironically. First, I learned to learn, and learn quickly; I also learned to explain very difficult and technical concepts in ways that less-experienced people could comprehend. Both skills have been central to my personal and professional development since, and I don't think that will change.

	Professionally: I didn't end up working in the finanical field. Instead, I found work at a Fintech startup called Carta. Carta is a platform by which other startups manage their employee and investor's equity, and I have filled various Delivery and Sales roles in my 5 years there. They're super cool, check them out.

Working in tech has been one endless stream of learnings, but one key observation I've made is that there are always more problems to solve. This is one of many things that drew me to web development, initially--the engineers always seemed to be solving the most interesting problems, and seemed to have unbounded capacity to solve problems in general, were they so motivated.

Personally: this may not come as a shock, but I'm a huge nerd. On the gaming end i play D&D, WoW, Magic the Gathering, boardgames of all kinds, you name it I'm probably a fan. 

I also have a passion for investing, both in the equities/derivatives market as well as real estate, and will ramble ad nausaeum about nerdy finance stuff like that. 

Lastly, I'm an avid reader (well, listener; audiobooks are far more convenient) of books from many genres. If it's not a book, I'm listening to podcasts or music, for which I'm equally ravenous.
