                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <p>
                    <em>Scholastically:</em> I went to business school to study Accounting, and finished up my undergraduate studies in December 2017. I was drawn to the Accounting field because I've always been a bit of a math nut, but Accounting specifically seemed like a field that was indispensable--everyone needs a tax guy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Professionally:</em> I didn't end up working in the finanical field. Instead, I found work at a Fintech startup called Carta. Carta is a platform by which other startups manage their employee and investor's equity, and I have filled various Delivery and Sales roles in my 5 years there. They're super cool, check them out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Personally:</em> this may not come as a shock, but I'm a huge nerd. On the gaming end i play D&D, WoW, Magic the Gathering, boardgames of all kinds, you name it I'm probably a fan. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also have a passion for investing, both in the equities/derivatives market as well as real estate, and will ramble ad nausaeum about nerdy finance stuff like that. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I'm an avid reader (well, listener; audiobooks are far more convenient) of books from many genres. If it's not a book, I'm listening to podcasts or music, for which I'm equally ravenous. 
                </p>
